# Bookstore app   

## v1.0.0   

This repository contains the frontend user interface for a virtual bookstore. Ultimately, the program is to be a fully web-based application.
I plan to expand it by adding a backend server to handle various functionalities such as user authentication, storing user data, managing inventory, and processing orders.

## Features    
* **Browse Books**: Users can browse the available list of books in the store. Each book is presented with its title, author and price.   
* **Add to Cart**: Users can add selected books to their shopping cart. They can also increase or decrease the quantity of book copies in the cart.   
* **Order**: After adding books to the cart, users can proceed to the ordering process. They can view a summary of the order and enter their contact information in a form.   

## Built With  
* Typescript   
* React
* Bootstrap
